# Magelearn CheckoutPhoneValidator with International Telephone Input JS
This module was intitally developped to provide custom validation for phone number field in Shipping and Billing address form.
I have also added some code to add additional class to telephone field with which you can add/modify css for different purpose.

After i found International Telephone Input JS https://intl-tel-input.com/ which is a Jquery Plugin for entering and validating international telephone numbers.

I have Integrate thisjQuery plugin in this Magento2 module. Which adds a country code flag with phone extension prefix dropdown to billing and shipping address telephone field.
